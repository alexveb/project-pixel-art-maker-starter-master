# Pixel Art Maker Project


## Instructions

To get started, open `designs.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

You'll be given starter code, including HTML and CSS, to build the application. You'll write JavaScript code that lets the user create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

Your users should be able to:

           - Dynamically set the size of the table as an _N_ by _M_ grid.
           - Choose a color.
           - Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
           
           
Your primary task is to implement the makeGrid() function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.
