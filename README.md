# Pixel Art Maker Project

Pixel Art Maker will run  when you will open index.html

## Instructions

You'll be given starter code, including HTML and CSS, to build the application. You'll write JavaScript code that lets the user create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

Your users should be able to:

           1. Dynamically set the size of the table as an _N_ by _M_ grid.
           2. Choose a color.
           3. Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
           
           
Your primary task is to implement the makeGrid() function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.
